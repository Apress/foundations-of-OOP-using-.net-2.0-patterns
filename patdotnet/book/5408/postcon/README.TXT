These are the samples that can be used to complete the Labs associated with the 
BASTA postcon conference tutorial "Implementing Patterns".  Each of the 
sub-directories represents one of the labs.

NOTE: lab 1.4 has implemented the plugin pattern for both Mono, and Microsoft 
.NET.  The small issue on Microsoft .NET is to use the method Assembly.Load 
otherwise the Visual Studio.NET environment considers the dynamically loaded 
assembly as not having the correct assembly.  This is EVEN THOUGH the assemblies 
might be identical.  As some my .NET friends have said, "maybe it would be a good 
case for Microsoft and the Mono team to develop some routines to test who 
implemented the specification correctly".

If you have questions, please do not hesistate to ask.  Note that the email 
address sengm@devspace.com is a moderated mailing list that you can use to ask 
questions about software engineering, patterns, presentations, tutorials, and 
books.
